# For the [ALORE]

### Overview
A landing page for all things ALORE. This originally sarted as a personal projects for my friends' side business, and led to the team using my site and domain. The website spotlights new events, releases, merchandise (coming soon...), and ALORE team members. 

A major attribute I focused on while creating this site was the loading animations and transitions. I am more streamlined when it comes to my project structure and components, which allowed me to implement loading animations and hover effects. The next iteration of the site will receive a much needed face lift, as well as functional improvements overall. A future goal is to include a shop page for merchandise and event tickets.
